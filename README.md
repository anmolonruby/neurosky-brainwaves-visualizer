#Neurosky Brain Waves Visualizer in Node.js

---

##App still in progress
Started up using a bit of the code from [this repo](https://github.com/bishopZ/node-neurosky-visualizer) but need to refactor all the code to remove the javascript & CSS from the HTML and start building the actual visualization.
